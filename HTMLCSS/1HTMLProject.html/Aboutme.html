                <span>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello everyone thank you for visiting my website, first let me tell you about me. Ok... my name is Fahmi Hidayat from Bangka Belitung and I am now 24 years old. I am very happy that my simple website based on HTML and CSS is finally finished. I've been studying programming since I was in college even though I studied in a non-IT major, electronics major to be precise but I like studying the world of programming starting from programming robots and then creating websites although this project doesn't include discussing programming but I hope this will be a foundation for more work and never satisfied with every achievement I make, again...again and again are the words that I always put in to motivate me to be even better</span>
